# Noora

Noora is a UI compiler for the web.
It's platform and language agnostic, and it's designed to be used with any web framework.
It builds on modern paradigms and concepts such as Web Components, scoped CSS, and state-driven UI.
Think of it as [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), but dropping the JavaScript dependency in development.

## Development

### Set up

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/nooradev/noora.git`
2. Install and activate system dependencies through [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/): `mise install`
3. Set up your environment to work with the project: `mise run up`.
4. You are ready to work on any of the projects under [`/packages`](./packages)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Using [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to activate versions is a strict requirement to ensure all environments are consistent and reproducible. Not using it might lead to wasted time and effort.
