# Noora

Noora is a UI compiler for the web.
It's platform and language agnostic, and it's designed to be used with any web framework.
It builds on modern paradigms and concepts such as Web Components, scoped CSS, and state-driven UI.
Think of it as [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), but dropping the JavaScript dependency in development.
